# Rec-E-Peasy

An application that allows you to add and store recipes that you want! Don't know the exact measurements? What's an ounce? What's a pound? What a liter? With Rec-E-Peasy, you can add your own custom amount as well. Let's say you cooked dumplings and you don't really know how much salt you added per measurement of meat, just put in something along the lines of "toothpaste cap" or "squeeze of lotion". Something personal to you and makes sense to you! Browse around public recipes and pin them onto your recipe page!
